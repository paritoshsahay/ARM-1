The reason why CODE-1 gives error is because in IF-THEN-ELSE the statement written in the particluar IF or THEN clause should be compatible with the condition checked otherwise simulator won't understand.
The simulator will understand which statement to execute on true value of condition and which one on false using the suffix mentioned. So that while executing ITE/ITTE it goes over all the statement but doesn't execute the ones which doesn't satisfy condition.
For example, in CODE-1 the MOV instruction is ususal instruction used in the code, it doesn't specify any special instruction to be excecuted according to condition, Whereas in CODE-2 the ADDLT/MOVLT and SUBGE tells the simulator which statement to execute on LT condition to be true and other one on false LT.
